# Portfolio - Fred Newton Akdogan

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, I showcase my work as a Unity and XR developer. This repository contains various projects that reflect my skills in Game Development, XR Development, and interactive 3D visualizations.

## Overview

The portfolio is an interactive experience fully developed in Unity. You can navigate through different projects and examples in an isometric view. The design avoids traditional UI elements to create a natural and immersive browsing experience.

### Projects
1. **XR Projects**: Interactive applications and tools involving Mixed Reality, Virtual Reality, and Augmented Reality.
2. **Game Development**: Smaller game projects that cover various aspects of game development, from mechanics to AI.
3. **3D Visualizations**: Creative representations of concepts and ideas in interactive 3D environments.

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation**: Move through the portfolio in an isometric view.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and WebGL platforms.
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Texts and information are seamlessly integrated into the 3D world.

## Development Status

Please note that this portfolio is currently under development. The interactive version is functional, but I am still working on finalizing the readable version, which will be completed soon.
